# This is a Fishfile, created by ocean inside a sea tornado of sharks!
#
# The fishfile is your ship's log and tells your adventures across the
# 7 seas and beyond. The old Fisherman will keep track of your plugins
# in this file. Plugins can be names, urls or paths.
#
# Comments and empty lines are never removed. You are the captain!
#
# You can store this file in any place you like and Fisherman will
# make a note to remember that.
#
#   set -g fisher_file ~/.config/fish/fishfile
#
# If you would like to restore a previous Fisherman installation, you
# can do so too:
#
#   fisher install < you/old/fishfile
#
# If you have upgraded from an Oh My Fish! setup, you can feed bundle
# file instead of a fishfile too. Fisherman will take care of it.

# Oh My Bundle? Add 'plugin-' or 'theme-' prefixes.

# You can install a plugin from a local directory too.

# You can also install a plugin from a gist. There is no formal way to name a gist,
# so a gist plugin is recommended to export a single fish function. The repository
# may include other files too, but there should be only *one* fish file.
