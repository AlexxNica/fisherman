.SH "NAME"
\fBfisher\-fishfile\fR \- Fishfile Format
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
A \fIfishfile\fR lets you share plugin configurations across multiple installations, allows plugins to declare dependencies, and prevent information loss in case of system failure\.
.
.P
Fisherman also keeps a user \fIfishfile\fR in \fB$fisher_file\fR which is automatically updated as you install or uninstall plugins\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
Fishfiles are plain text, manifest files that list one or more plugins by their name, URL or path to a local project\.
.
.P
Here is an example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# my plugins
shark
fishtape

# other links
oh\-my\-fish/bobthefish
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
To read fishfiles use \fBfisher \-\-file=fishfile\fR\. This will read \fIfishfile\fR sequentially, writing its contents to the standard output\. oh\-my\-fish bundle files are supported as well\.
.
.P
If \fIfishfile\fR is null or an empty string, the global \fIfishfile\fR in \fB$fisher_file\fR will be used\. Use a dash \fB\-\fR to force read from standard input\.
.
.SH "PLUGINS"
Plugins may declare any number of dependencies to other plugins in a fishfile at the root of their project\.
.
.P
By default, when Fisherman installs a plugin, it will also fetch and install its dependencies\. If a dependency is already installed, it will not be updated as this could potentially break other plugins using an older version\. For the same reason, uninstalling a plugin does not remove its dependencies\.
.
.P
To understand this behavior, it helps to recall the shell\'s single scope for functions\. The lack of private functions means that, it is \fInot\fR possible to single\-lock a specific dependency version\. See also \fBFlat Tree\fR in \fBfisher help tour\fR\.
