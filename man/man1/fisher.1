.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Fisherman is a plugin manager for \fBfish\fR(1) that lets you share and reuse code, prompts and configurations easily\.
.
.P
The following commands are available: \fIinstall\fR, \fIuninstall\fR, \fIupdate\fR, \fIsearch\fR and \fIhelp\fR\. See \fBfisher\fR help \fIcommand\fR for information about each command\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-f\fR \fB\-\-file\fR=\fIfishfile\fR: Read \fIfishfile\fR and write contents to standard output\. If \fIfishfile\fR is null or an empty string, your user \fIfishfile\fR in \fB$fisher_config\fR/fishfile will be used instead\. Use a dash \fB\-\fR to force reading from the standard input\. Oh My Fish! bundle files are supported as well\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-validate\fR=\fIkeyword\fR: Validate a \fIname\fR or \fIurl\fR\. If \fIkeyword\fR resembles a url, the algorithm will attempt to normalize the url by adding / removing missing components\. Otherwise, it will assume \fIkeyword\fR is a potential plugin name and use the following regex \fB^[a\-z]+[\._\-]?[a\-z0\-9]+\fR to validate the string\. This method is used internally to validate user input and support url variations such as \fIowner/repo\fR, \fIgh:owner/repo\fR, \fIbb:owner/repo\fR, etc\. See \fBfisher\fR(7)#{\fBPlugins\fR}\.
.
.IP
If \fIkeyword\fR is null or an empty string, \fB\-\-validate\fR reads keyword\fIs\fR from the standard input\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-\-cache\fR[=\fIbase\fR] Retrieve the path of every plugin downloaded to \fB$fisher_cache\fR\. Includes plugins installed using a custom URL\. Use \-\-cache=\fIbase\fR to select only the name of the plugin\. See \fBbasename\fR(1)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-version\fR: Show version information\. Fisherman\'s current version can be found in the VERSION file at the root of the project\. The version scheme is based in \fBSemantic Versioning\fR and uses Git annotated tags to track releases\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR: Show usage help\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "CUSTOM COMMANDS"
A Fisherman command is a function that you can invoke using the \fBfisher\fR utility\. By convention, any function of the form \fBfisher_<my_command>\fR is registered as Fisherman command\.
