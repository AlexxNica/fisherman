fisher-faq(7) -- Frequently Asked Questions
===========================================

## SYNOPSIS

This document attempts to answer some of Fisherman most frequently asked questions. Feel free to create a new issue in the Fisherman issue tracker if your question is not answered here.


### What is Fisherman?

Fisherman is a plugin manager for fish that lets you share and reuse code, prompts and configurations easily.


### What do I need to know to use Fisherman?

Nothing. You can continue using your shell as usual. When you are ready to learn more just type `man fisher` or `man 7 fisher`.


### How do I access other Fisherman documentation?

Fisherman documentation is based in UNIX `man(1)` pages. See `man fisher` and `man 7 fisher` to get started. You can also access any documentation using the `fisher help` command.


### What are Fisherman plugins?

Plugins are written in fish and extend the shell core functionality, run initialization code, add completions or documentations to other commands, etc. See `fisher help plugins`.

Plugins may list any number of dependencies to other plugins using a *fishfile*.


### What is a Fishfile?

A plain text file that lists what plugins you have installed or a plugin's dependencies to other plugins.

Fishfiles let you share plugin configurations across multiple installations, allow plugins to declare dependencies, and prevent information loss in case of system failure. See also `fisher help fishfile`.


### What kind of Fisherman plugins are there?

There is no technical distinction between plugins, themes, commands, etc., but there is a *conceptual* difference.

* `Standalone Utilities`: Plugins that define one or more functions, meant to be used at the command line.

* `Prompts / Themes`: Plugins that modify the appearance of the fish prompt by defining a `fish_prompt` and / or `fish_right_prompt` functions.

* `Extension Commands`: Plugins that extend Fisherman default commands. An extension plugin must define one or more functions like `fisher_<my_command>`. For specific information about commands, see `fisher help commands` and then return to this guide.

* `Configuration Plugins`: Plugins that include one or more `my_plugin.config.fish` files. Files that follow this convention are evaluated at the start of the session.

See `fisher help plugins` and `fisher help commands`.


### Does Fisherman support oh-my-fish plugins and themes?

Yes. To install either a plugin or theme use their URL:

```
fisher install omf/plugin-{rbenv,tab} omf/theme-scorphish
```

You can use the same mechanism to install any valid plugin from any given URL. See also `Compatibility` in `fisher(7)`.


### What does Fisherman do exactly every time I create a new shell session?

Essentially, add Fisherman functions and completions to the `$fish_{function,complete}_path` and evaluate files that follow the convention `*.config.fish`.

```fish
set fish_function_path {$fisher_config,$fisher_home}/functions $fish_function_path
set fish_complete_path {$fisher_config,$fisher_home}/completions $fish_complete_path

for file in $fisher_config/conf.d/*.config.fish
    source $file
end
```

See `$fisher_home/config.fish` for the full code.


### How is Fisherman faster than oh-my-fish/Wahoo, etc?

Fisherman ameliorates the slow shell start problem using a flat dependency tree instead of loading a directory hierarchy per plugin. This also means that Fisherman performance does not decline depending on the number of plugins installed. See also `Flat Tree` in `fisher(7)`.

### Why don't you contribute your improvements back to oh-my-fish instead of creating a new project?

I have contributed back to oh-my-fish extensively. See also oh-my-fish history for August 27, 2015 when another project, Wahoo, was entirely merged with oh-my-fish.

In addition, Fisherman was built from the ground up using a completely different design, implementation and set of principles.

Some features include: UNIX familiarity, minimalistic design, flat tree structure, unified plugin architecture, external self-managed database, cache system, dependency manifest file and compatibility with oh-my-fish, etc. See `fisher(7)`.


### How can I upgrade from an existing oh-my-fish or Wahoo installation?

Install Fisherman.

```
git clone https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman
cd fisherman
make
```

You can now safely remove oh-my-fish `$OMF_PATH` and `$OMF_CONFIG`.

Backup dotfiles and other sensitive data first.

```fish
rm -rf {$OMF_PATH,$OMF_CONFIG}
```


### I changed my prompt with `fish_config` and now I can't use any Fisherman theme, what do I do?

`fish_config` persists the prompt to `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish`. That file takes precedence over Fisherman prompts that installs to `$fisher_config/functions`. To use Fisherman prompts remove the `fish_promt.fish` inside `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/functions`.

Assuming `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is `~/.config` in your system:

```
rm ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish
```


### How do I use fish as my default shell?

Add Fish to `/etc/shells`:

```sh
echo "/usr/local/bin/fish" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
```

Make Fish your default shell:

```sh
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```

To switch back to another shell.

```sh
chsh -s /bin/another/shell
```


### Why is this FAQ similar to the oh-my-fish FAQ?

Because it was written by the same author of Fisherman and Wahoo and some of the questions and answers simply overlap.
